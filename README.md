# Simple-YT-to-MP3-Converter
For a while I've been having issues with online converter since I often listen to beats and download them to try them out in FL Studio and keep encountering slow websites that often push adware and occasionally viruses onto me so I decided to make on in Py to make my life a little bit easier
#todo Adding more features and design options to the gui, not anything special because the only thing I really need this and use it for is to download and the program itself is as simple as it gets. Am a beginner so if anyone has any improvements let me know :)
